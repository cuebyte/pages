This week, one of my colleague was been fired, at the end of his probation. According to the leaders, he always unhappy about his work, they talked to him, let him change a project. However, he still unhappy, bad teamwork, bad performance, doesn't cooperate with peers, use Kotlin and Spark that no one use in company. And the CTO told him 2 weeks ago, "if you still don't have good performance, you will be fired". And yes, he was fired.

But, he worked here for 5 months and 3 weeks. He just "suddenly" been kicked out, asked to leave the name tag and laptop, with half bottle of juice left on the desk. What's more criticial, he is Iranian, he is a immigrant, being fired means… means too much heavy thing to he and his wife…

To me, to every Java developer works here, we know that he is a develop with a lot of good knowledge, he's unhappy cause of the shity legecy project. His bad teamwork, maybe parts come from his character, parts come from his un-surrender.

However for me, the thing that really shocked me, is not how irresponsible, how bastard the leaders in this company, but how no sense the peers here. After the CTO declare the fire, he said today is a suck day, but one immigrant Java guy said "But today's weather is good", with his smiling, and he even has no intersection with him. And after the Java team leader explained the reason to fire him, I can see many guys relaxed face, start laughing, making jokes about him or his fire.

I would say, this company's leaders are shitty, so the product is shitty, of cause. They don't know how to lead people. He was unhappy, you talk, that's good, but as he is a smart guy, why you can not convince him? Maybe because no body can change the the shit become gold? If he cannot be convinced, why you don't fire him early? Until his end of probation? You really don't care about other one's life? He even doesn't has the time to find the next step.

And most of people in this compnay are suckers, are cowards, are cynics.
